/*

the  big   takeaway  from    it
are   :  
arrys  are very    strict of theit  type
tuples    are  arrays  were   you can  define   different   types
like    [number   ,  boolean   ,  string]
objects     have    their   keys  tied to  datatypes 
those types   can   be  replaced   only  with   values  of the  same   type
